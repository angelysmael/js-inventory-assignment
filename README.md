# Store Inventory - JavaScript Classes

This project is for my JavaScript assignment about classes, inheritance,
static methods, and basic store management.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Open the browser DevTools console to see logs.
3. The main output also shows inside the "Output" section on the page.

The demo creates some products (like T-Shirt, Sneakers, Eggs, Ice Cream),
adds them to a store, applies a 15% discount, and searches for one product by name.
